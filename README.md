Thunderbird add-on: re-send mails

    The only thing that saves us from the bureaucracy is inefficiency.

Eugene McCarthy

I am working as a system admin at a "huge" company. The managers are the layer cake at this Co. So a project is usually too long, and too complicated. I do not like this slow motion style, so usually I do this.

At the morning I open my "Sent" folder and look for messages haven't been relied. I "Edit as new.." them and without any changes I send them. Generally after 2-3 weeks they answer.

My add-on is doing the same. Maybe this is a bit brutal, but when somebody NEEDS an answer, everything is allowed! Maybe the next stage would be not forcing but reminding them, but at the moment I am a bit pissed off on guys like these slow colleagues.
